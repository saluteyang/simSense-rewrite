# simSense-rewrite
simSense rewritten compliant with tidyverse (curve simulation and visualization tool)

This is a more fully-fledged version of the toy example of simVisSkeleton. It has been updated to use the tidyverse pacakge universe so the older simSense with similiar functionalities is now archived.

This consists of a tabPanel with user-set controls and a mainPanel which is made up of different tabs for results and visualizations as stated in the following:

1. Plots of forward curves

2. Plots of simulated forward curves, i.e., distribution plots

3. Table with select percentiles with corresponding data points

4. Distribution of strips of simulated prices for pricing financial instruments comprised of such strips

5. Pricing/visualization of a particular kind of financial option commonly found in commodity trading markets
